  You can see the solution with a layout demo with grid and the cards I made it with flex
- What was your experience?
  Just I love it cause I learned a new property of css that his name is write-mode and it saved me a lot of time and I don't used transorm, rotate, translate, stuffs innecesaries, etc.

    Wrting-mode property, I would recomend y'all devs.
